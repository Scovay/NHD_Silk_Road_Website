    <p>China during the Han dynasty sent out emissaries and led by Zhang Qian. He encountered different cultures and found superior horses from Greco-Bactrians descended from Alexander the Great’s army which he called the “Dayuan” which means “Great Ionians". When he found the horses, he reported to the current emperor Wu which then used them against the currently maundering Xiongnu which led the emperor to wonder what other goods and benefits they could get from trading with the west.</p>
    <p>The Silk Road was a network of trading routes that connected China to the West.  The Han Dynasty officially opened it first and it lasted through multiple. Not only did goods and services travel along the road, but culture, politics, religions, and beliefs and ideas too. Silk and china went westward, while wools, gold, and silver went eastward. China also received Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism (from India) via the Silk Road. The Silk Roads life span was from 130 BC to 220 AD</p>
