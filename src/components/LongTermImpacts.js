      <p>Because of how long usage of the Silk was, 10, 25, or 50 years later cannot be described as very long. Instead, we look for periods like 100, 250, or 500 years after. First, religion spread. Buddhism went to the west while Christianity went to the east. Goods on both sides of the Silk Road became more available. The Chinese valued Roman metalworking and horses while the Romans valued Chinese silk and China (plates, bowls, etc.). In general, the economy grew a lot even multiple decades and centuries after the creation of the Silk Road.</p>
