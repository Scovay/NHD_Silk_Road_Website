      <p className = "text-blurb">Because of how long usage of the Silk was, 10, 25, or 50 years later cannot be described as very long. Instead, we look for periods like 100, 250, or 500 years after. First, religion spread. Buddhism went to the west while Christianity went to the east. Goods on both sides of the Silk Road became more available. The Chinese valued Roman metalworking and horses while the Romans valued Chinese silk and China (plates, bowls, etc.). In general, religions and ideologies of the west were spread to the east, the religions and ideologies of the east spread to the west, technologies/inventions along with newfound knowlewge spread along the Silk Road offering better quality of life for people that were affected by the Silk Road, the economy grew a lot even multiple decades and centuries after the creation of the Silk Road.</p>
